## Using metrics and events
{: #usingmetrics}

With **pre-defined metrics** you can answer questions like:

*How many new users do I have?*  
*How many people are actively using my app?*  
*How frequently are people using my app?*  
*What time of day are people using my app?*  
*What device models do my users prefer?*  
*When should I deprecate support for legacy operation systems?*  
*Which apps are experiencing performance issues?*  

By adding your own **custom events** you can answer questions like:  

*What features are used most and least?*  
*Where are users entering and leaving my app?*  
*What activities are users viewing most?*  
*Are users completing workflows in the app? (for example, conversion funnels)*  

<!--Client-side logs and usage data are gathered automatically and sent to the Mobile Analytics -->
<!-- service on demand. Developers and -->
<!-- administrators can use the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} service dashboard to view data that -->
<!-- is gathered by the client SDK. -->

<!--## Data visualization
{: data-visualization}

All data that is collected by the analytics service can be visualized through the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} dashboard which is accessible from your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard by clicking your IBM {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} service tile instance. You can also create custom charts, based on data that is collected by the analytics service in the dashboard. In addition to an at-a-glance view of your mobile analytics, the analytics feature includes the capability to perform a raw search against client logs, captured client crash data, and any extra data that you explicitly provide through client API function calls that feed into the {{site.data.keyword.mobileanalytics_short}} service. -->

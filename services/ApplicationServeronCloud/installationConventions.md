## Liberty Collective Installation Conventions

A Liberty collective is installed and configured following a standardized directory structure. The following list notes a few of the important settings.  See /etc/virtualimage.properties for a full list of the settings.

* IHS_HOME=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/HTTPServer
* IHS_INSTALL_ROOT=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/HTTPServer

**Note**:
* Maintenance can be applied by using the [Installation Manager](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDV2W_1.8.3/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/helpindex_imic.html){: new_window} installed in the /home/virtuser/IBM/Installation Manager directory. Since the underlying binaries are installed as virtuser, ensure that all fix packs and interim fixes are installed as virtuser.
* Ensure that starting and stopping servers from the command line is performed as the WebSphere Administrative ID, not as virtuser

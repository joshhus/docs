# Configuring tool integrations
{: #integrations}

*Last updated: 28 April 2016*

You can configure tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks while you create a toolchain, or you can add and configure tool integrations to customize an existing toolchain.  
{:shortdesc}

**Important**: This capability is experimental. Toolchains might not be stable and might change in ways that are not compatible with earlier versions. They are not recommended for use in production environments. To use toolchains, you must make a one-time [request for access](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/devops?cm_mmc=IBMBluemixGarageMethod-_-MethodSite-_-10-19-15::12-31-18-_-toolchains-welcome-page){: new_window}. Toolchains are available in the US South region only.

**Tip**: If you want to start developing with your source code, make sure that you configure the GitHub and GitHub Issues tool integrations before you configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}.

## Configuring the delivery pipeline
{: #deliverypipeline}

The {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} automates the continuous deployment of your projects through sequences of stages that retrieve input and run jobs, such as builds, tests, and deployments. 

Configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to automate the continuous building, testing, and deployment of your apps: 

1. If you are configuring this tool integration as you are creating the toolchain, in the Configurable Integrations section, click **Delivery Pipeline**. Depending on the template that you use, different fields might be available. Review the default field values and if needed, change those settings.
1. If you have a toolchain and are adding this tool integration to it, on the DevOps dashboard, on the **Toolchains** tab, click the toolchain to open its Tool Integrations page. Alternatively, on the app's Overview page, on the Continuous Delivery tile, click **View Toolchain**. Then, click **Tool Integrations**. 
1. Click the add button (+).
1. In the Tool Integrations section, click **Delivery Pipeline**.
1. Specify a name for your new pipeline.
1. If you plan to use your pipeline to deploy a user interface, select the **Viewable App** check box. All of the apps that your pipeline creates are shown in the **VIEW APP** list on the toolchain's Tool Integrations page.
1. Click **Create Integration** to add the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to your toolchain.
1. Click the tile for {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to view the pipeline and configure it. To learn the basics of configuring a pipeline, see [Building and deploying pipelines](../services/DeliveryPipeline/build_deploy.html){: new_window}.

  **Tip**: If you want to trigger the pipeline when you push changes to your GitHub repository (repo), you must configure GitHub for your toolchain before you define the stages for your pipeline. The pipeline stages need the Git URLs for your GitHub repos. Each pipeline stage can refer to only one of the GitHub repos that is associated with your toolchain. For instructions to configure GitHub, see the [GitHub and GitHub Issues](#github) section.
  
1. Optional: If you want Sauce Labs to run tests on your app, configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to add a Sauce Labs test job. For instructions to configure the test job, see the [Configuring a Sauce Labs test job in your pipeline](#config_saucelabs) section.

### Configuring a Sauce Labs test job in your pipeline
{: #config_saucelabs}

Before you configure a Sauce Labs test job in your pipeline, you need a working pipeline that has stages to build and deploy your app, and you must configure Sauce Labs for your toolchain. For instructions to configure Sauce Labs, see the [Sauce Labs](#saucelabs) section.

Configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to add a Sauce Labs test job:

1. If you don't have a stage that deploys a test version of your app, create one.
1. In the stage, add a test job after the deploy job. By placing these jobs in the same stage, they can access the same set of environment properties.   
  ![Test job](images/toolchain_test_job.png) 

1. Configure the stage: 

  a. On the **ENVIRONMENT PROPERTIES** tab, create three properties: CF_APP_NAME, SAUCE_USERNAME, and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY.
  
  b. Enter your Sauce Labs user name and access key. By doing so, you externalize those values so that you can use them in your tests.
  
1. Configure the deploy job. In the **Deploy Script** field, include this command: export CF_APP_NAME="$CF_APP". That command exports the app name as an environment property.
1. Configure the test job. The values in the following image are examples. The **Service Instance**, **Target**, **Organization**, and **Space** fields are populated with the Sauce Labs user name, region, org, and space that you are currently using.  
![Configure job](images/toolchain_configure_job.png)

  a. For the tester type, select **Sauce Labs**.
  
  b. For the service instance, select the Sauce Labs user name that you used when you configured Sauce Labs for your toolchain. 
  
   **Tip**: To see the user name and access key that you used when you configured Sauce Labs for your toolchain, click **Configure**. 
  
  c. In the **Test Execution Command** field, enter the commands that install the dependencies that are required by your tests and then run the tests. For example, for a hypothetical Node.js app, you might enter:
     ```
     npm install
     node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt test:sauce:parallel
     ```
  
    d. If you want to see your test reports in the test job logs, select the **Enable Test Report** check box, and set the Test Result File Pattern to `test/*.xml`.
  
1. Click **SAVE**. Now, whenever your pipeline runs, your Sauce Labs tests run.

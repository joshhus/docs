# Network plans

Both IBM Blockchain on Bluemix networks, the Starter Developer plan and the High Security Business Network plan, unlock features in Hyperledger Fabric v0.6, which robustly enhance availability, security, confidentiality and privacy. Each instance runs as a four-node network, with a Certificate Authority managing identities and member permissions. The only difference between the two plans is their operating environment; the developer network runs in a shared multi-tenant environment on {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}}, whereas the high security network is an isolated single tenant running as an appliance on IBM Secure Service Container.

<!---The High-Security business network provides important capabilities above and beyond the two-node multi-tenant developer service on Softlayer (aimed towards application development; writing chaincode and experimenting with APIs).  The high security plan supplies your own private blockchain test environment, which has been vetted and secured by IBM.  With the following features, your dedicated and high security environment enables you to take the next step towards preparing your organization for enterprise blockchain networks:~~

~~1. A dedicated four-node blockchain network; single-tenant with no shared resources~~
~~2. An IBM-certified version of the latest Hyperledger fabric, along with mechanisms to unlock inherent identity and security features~~
~~3. Isolation and protection from system and platform administrators, root users, and unauthorized users.~~
~~4. Verified test cases for security, consensus, availability, and performance--->
